Due to disk space limitations, we cannot include the source code
to XFree86 3.1.2 with the FTP distribution.  (It will be included,
of course, with the CD-ROM distribution.)  You can find the source
code to X11R6 at `ftp.x.org' in the directory `/pub/R6' and the
patches to create XFree86-3.1.2 from X11R6 at `ftp.xfree86.org'
in `/pub/XFree86/3.1.2/patches/XFree86-3.1.2.diff.gz'.

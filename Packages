 The GNU accounting utilities include `ac', `accton', `last', `lastcomm',

 to Debian GNU/Linux.  "Login accounting" provides summaries of system
 resource usage based on connect time, and "process accounting" provides
 summaries based on the commands executed on the system.  `lastcomm' and
 `sa' require kernel support provided by the default kernel included
 with Debian GNU/Linux (this support is not yet provided in the standard
 kernel distribution).  More information can be found in the `accounting'
 Info page.

 Please note that 'last' is now available as a seperate package.

 With beav, you can edit a file in HEX, ASCII, EBCDIC,
 OCTAL, DECIMAL, and BINARY.  You can display but not edit
 data in FLOAT mode.  You can search or search and replace
 in any of these modes.  Data can be displayed in BYTE,
 WORD, or DOUBLE WORD formats.  While displaying WORDS
 or DOUBLE WORDS the data can be displayed in INTEL's or
 MOTOROLA's byte ordering.   Data of any length can be
 inserted at any point in the file.  The source of this
 data can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file.
 Any data that is being displayed can be sent to a printer
 in the displayed format.  Files that are bigger than

 Lout reads a mark-up file - ie, a plain text file containing

 Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and

 TeX or LaTeX.  Lout comes with full documentation about writing Lout
 documents, and it produces very small and clean PostScript output.

 However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are
 fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer
 local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to
 find many Lout documents floating around the 'net.

 Metafont is a powerful engine for font design, equipped with
 a macro processor similar to TeX's. The <Meta> means you could
 design a font using an arbitrary number of parameters and then
 create a series of fonts by just changing these parameters.
 It even allows interactive generation of fonts under the X11
 window system.

 TeX's default fonts, the cm-series are specified using Metafont.

 The normal user however will not use Metafont directly. It will
 be called automatically whenever bitmaps of a Metafont-Font are

 The PARI system is a package which is capable of doing formal

 at number theorists, but can be used by people whose primary need is
 speed.
 .
 Although quite an amount of symbolic manipulation is possible in PARI,
 this system does very badly compared to much more sophisticated
 systems like Axiom, Macsyma, Magma, Maple, Mathematica or Reduce on
 such manipulations (e.g. multivariate polynomials, formal integration,
 etc...). On the other hand, the two main advantages of the system
 are its speed (which can be between 5 and 100 times better on many
 computations than the above mentioned systems), and the possibility of
 using directly data types which are familiar to mathematicians.

description: TeX - The typesetting system
 TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth as a general typesetting
 engine that reads text together with interspersed commands,
 formats it and outputs a device independent description of
 the formatted pages. The input file is plain ascii, i.e. TeX
 does not feature a WYSIWYG approach to typesetting.
 .
 TeX includes a powerful macro processor allowing the creation
 of higher level packages hiding the TeX primitives from the
 user. The best known and most widely used of these is LaTeX.
 .
 Although designed with a strong emphasis on mathematics (and
 still the formulas generated by TeX are of a quality unsurpassed
 by widely used commercial packages) it's high quality linebreaking
 algorithm, the possibility to use multiple languages, fonts and
 encodings make it useful in many other fields as well.

description: Tinyfugue MUD client for TinyMUDs and LPMUDs
 TinyFugue (also known as "Fugue" or "TF") is a line-based
 client designed for connecting to MUD servers (note: LP,
 DIKU, and other servers which use prompts require "/lp
 on"; see /help prompts). TinyFugue runs on UNIX-like systems,
 and on OS/2.
 .
 TinyFugue is larger than most MUD clients, but has many
 more features and is much more flexible. The goal is to
 provide the most functionality in a client that still
 maintains the user-friendliness of Tinytalk. Clients with
 extension languages such as Tcltt or VaporTalk can do a
 little more in certain areas, but are considerably harder
 to use and learn. TF provides most of these abilities in
 such a manner that learning to use any one function is
 relatively easy.
